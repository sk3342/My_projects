Project Title: Data Analytics Pipeline for User and Network Log Analysis

Objective: The goal of this project is to design and implement a data analytics pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) data from a MySQL database containing user information and network logs. The pipeline provides actionable insights into user activities based on the logs.

Project Title: Flight Fare Prediction and Analysis

Objective: The goal of this project is to develop a data analytics pipeline that predicts flight fares based on various factors such as departure and arrival locations, flight duration, airline, and time of booking. The project will also analyze historical flight fare data to provide insights into fare trends and pricing strategies.

Project Description for Flight Fare Prediction
Data Collection:

Gather historical flight fare data from various sources, including airline websites, travel agencies, and public datasets. The dataset should include features such as:
Departure and arrival airports
Flight duration
Airline
Date and time of departure
Date and time of booking
Class of service (economy, business, first)
Number of stops
Data Preprocessing:

Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting categorical variables into numerical formats using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
Normalize or standardize numerical features to improve the performance of machine learning models.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Perform EDA to visualize and understand the relationships between different features and flight fares.
Use visualizations such as scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps to identify trends and patterns in the data.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features that may improve the predictive power of the model, such as:
Days until departure
Seasonal trends (e.g., holidays, peak travel seasons)
Historical fare averages for specific routes
Model Development:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting) to build a predictive model for flight fares.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
