Project Overview
Objective: To predict the likelihood of an employee leaving the organization using historical HR data.
Dataset: Simulated dataset of employee attributes.
Steps:
Data Understanding: Load and explore the dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical data, scale features.
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Uncover patterns and correlations.
Feature Engineering: Create new features and select the most important ones.
Model Building: Train ML models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
Deployment: Save the best model and demonstrate predictions.
